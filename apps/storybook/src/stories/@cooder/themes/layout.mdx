# Layout

Layout is the visual arrangement of elements. It directs attention to the most important information on the screen and makes it easy for users to take action.
Product layouts must adapt to fit different screen sizes and form factors including mobile, tablet, foldable, and large-screen devices. When creating a layout, consider how the spacing and the parts of layout work together.

### Breakpoints
